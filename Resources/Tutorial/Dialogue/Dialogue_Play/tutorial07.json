    "Radish Boy": "Gosh, I'm so thirsty! I almost forgot that being underground for too long can give me extreme thirst!",

    "Radish Boy": "I should drink those water puddles to replenish myself!",

    "Radish Boy": "Hmmm...maybe I should practicing my hiding against those insect dummies at town square.",

    "Radish Boy": "I can try to hide myself in those grass before I get spotted by the dummy. Hiding in grasses won't make me thirsty so it's a good practice just in case I'm low on water."
